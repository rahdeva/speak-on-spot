**An impromptu speaking practice app**

SpeakOnSpot helps you develop spontaneous speaking skills through random prompts and intelligent time feedback, designed to encourage quick thinking, clear structure, and confident delivery.

The experience is designed to promote:
- **Quick thinking** — respond spontaneously without preparation
- **Simple structure** — organize thoughts on the fly
- **Clarity over perfection** — focus on ideas, not flawless delivery

### Quote
Reflect on or respond to an inspirational quote.
> *Example:* "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."

### Statement
Take a position on a thought-provoking statement.
> *Example:* "Remote work makes people less productive."

### Question

> *Example:* "What is the best advice you've ever received?"

## 🎨 Time Range Visual Feedback

When using **Time Range Mode**, the app provides **non-intrusive visual cues** by changing the background color in real-time:

- 🟢 **Green (Minimum Time Reached)**  
  You've met the minimum duration — feel free to continue or wrap up.

- 🟡 **Yellow (Mid Range)**  
  Ideal zone for delivering your main points and starting your conclusion.

- 🔴 **Red (Maximum Time Reached)**  
  Maximum time limit reached — time to conclude your speech.

> **Design Philosophy:** Feedback is visual and supportive, not intrusive. No loud alarms or stressful countdowns — just gentle guidance to keep you aware of time while staying focused on speaking.
